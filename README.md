### KDS Showcase project

In this test, you will develop a SPA with React to browse an API endpoint. (choose one of the public APIs from here: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

Showcase a data table (including pagination) with a brief description (max five columns),
where the user can click on one of the elements and show the full description of the item.

Requirements:

- Use React, ideally with redux too
- Choose your own UI components library (internally we use our home made library, but you are free to choose whichever you want)
- Versioning the code with git
- Bonus: showcase the API by deploying it (hint: github pages, zeit.co, heroku, â€¦)
